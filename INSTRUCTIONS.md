# Rappi ML Engineer challenge üí™

Hi there! Thank you for applying for our ML Engineer role. We have a lot of exciting stuff to build and we are glad you choose to apply.

The goal of this challenge is to test your software engineering and machine learning skills.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We are going to evaluate your **code**, **best practices** and **communication skills**, not the precision of the model. So show us your best coding practices üôå

## Instructions

We need you to build a python package with a CLI to train and evaluate a ML model over the famous [Kaggle's Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

### Requirements

- Code should be written using _object oriented programming_.
- Package should have a _command-line interface_ (CLI) to interact with the code.
- Code should be tested and a coverage report should be included.

### Expected outputs

- A Github repository with the package and a `README.md` indicating how to use it.
- A Jupyter notebook with an analysis of the results with:
  - Your evaluation metrics and the explanation of them: _Is this a good model? A bad one? Why?_
  - What are the most important features for the ML model: _All the features are equally important? What are the most useful ones? Why?_
  - An explanation of how we can put on production the model (please mention the technologies that you'd use and MLOps best practices): _What system architecture you'd use? How we can automate stuff? Which cloud services you'd use? Why?_
- A coverage report of the tests indicating how we can read it.

### Advices

- Concentrate on the quality of the package more than on the precision of the model. The titanic problem is really famous and there are tons of solutions for it. We don't want the most precise ML model, we want to know how good are you coding ML **systems**.
- Please show us your best practices. If some of them aren't in the requirements don't hesitate to include them, they are going to be like extra bonuses.
